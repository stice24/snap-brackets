# snap-brackets

**Description:**

- This algorithm is applicable to all forms of bracket games (e.g. https://www.snapchat.com/lens/3883d1d78b6c442c90586fb96ce8cb19?type=SNAPCODE&metadata=01)

- Specifically, this is bracket games driven by head tilts

- Internally, various scripts based on touch, sound, or other movements can be directly used to replace head tilts and maintain the bracket qualities

- As for the bracket frontend UX, image scripts just need to be switched out, and otherwise, bracket spots can be adjusted via shape, color, etc.
